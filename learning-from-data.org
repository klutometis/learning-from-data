*** a
    - $X$ :: Vitals, DNA expression
    - $Y$ :: Presence/absence of problem(s)
    - $f$ :: Given these vitals, etc., what are the applicable problems?
    - data :: Vitals and problem(s) per patient over time
*** b
    - $X$ :: Handwriting glyphs
    - $Y$ :: Symbols they correspond to
    - $f$ :: Given this glyph, what is the corresponding symbol?
    - data :: E.g. 64x64 PNGs, one per glyph
*** c
    - $X$ :: Email body, sender
    - $Y$ :: Whether spam or not
    - $f$ :: Given this email and sender, is it spam?
    - data :: Emails
*** d
    - $X$ :: Price, temperature and day of week at some given time
    - $Y$ :: Load
    - $f$ :: Given price, etc., what is the load?
    - data :: Collection of price-temperator-day tuples at times $T$.
*** e
    - $X$ :: Education, race, religion, income
    - $Y$ :: Supports Trump
    - $f$ :: Given education, etc., how likely to support Trump?
    - data :: Education, etc. tuples from survey.
** Exercise 1.2
* Notes
** Chapter 1
   - Input $x$; target function $f: X \to Y$; input space $X$; output space $Y$;
     data set $D = (x_1, y_1), ...$; hypothesis $H$, candidate $g: X \to Y$ that
     approximates $f$.
   - Issues decision on $g$, $f$ remains unknown.
   - Hypothesis set and learning algorithm: learning model.
   - Approve credit if $\Sum^d_{i=1}w_ix_i > threshold$, etc.:
     $h(x)=sign((\Sum^d_{i=1}w_ix_i) + b)
   - All hypotheses $h \in H$
   - This model of H call the perceptron.
   - Perceptron classification of linearly separable data in a two dimension
     input space
   - Some of the weights negative, corresponding to adverse effect on credit
     approval.
   - Expectation of (variable - mean)^2 is the variance
   - I.i.d.: independent and identically distributed
   - Linearity of expectation
   - Begin from definition of expectation
